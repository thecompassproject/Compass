# Open Source GUI Platform For Teaching and Implementing Computational Physics

## About the project

We have developed an Open Source GUI for Teaching and Implementing Computational Physics. It allows users to study the dynamics of a number of physical systems and predict their evolutionary behaviour using several numerical techniques. Users can also learn how to write C++ programs for solving these problems.

## Built With

1. **C++** -
   All our programs are written in C++ as it is what we ultimately intend to teach.
2. **Django** -
   The web application has been developed using Django - a Python framework.
3. **HTML-CSS-JavaScript** -
   These languages have been used to design the UI.

## Prerequisites

Before the user can run the application, a few things need to be set up:

1. Install a text editor like VS Code, Sublime etc.
2. Install Gnuplot
3. Install Python
4. Install C++
5. Install Microsoft Build Tools

## Getting Started

The following instructions will help the user to get started with the project for the first time:

1. Open Command Prompt/Terminal and navigate to a path of your choice.
2. Run the following command to get the project code from the GitHub:” git clone https://github.com/samreetdhillon/IAPT.git”.
3. Run “cd IAPT”.
4. If you are using a Windows machine, then run “setup.bat” command to setup the project. For Linux/Mac machines, run “source setup.sh command to set up the project.
