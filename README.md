# Open Source GUI Platform For Teaching and Implementing Computational Physics

## About the project

We have developed an Open Source GUI for Teaching and Implementing Computational Physics. It allows users to study the dynamics of a number of physical systems and predict their evolutionary behaviour using several numerical techniques. Users can also learn how to write C++ programs for solving these problems.

## Built With

1. **C++** -
   All our programs are written in C++ as it is what we ultimately intend to teach.
2. **Django** -
   The web application has been developed using Django - a Python framework.
3. **HTML-CSS-JavaScript** -
   These languages have been used to design the UI.

## Prerequisites

Before the user can run the application, a few things need to be set up:

1. Install a text editor like VS Code, Sublime etc.
2. Install Gnuplot (https://sourceforge.net/projects/gnuplot/files/gnuplot/)
3. Install Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
4. Install C++ (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/features/cplusplus/)
5. Install Microsoft Build Tools (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
(Don't forget to add all these files to System Environment Varibles)

## How to use this application?
